\section{Future Work}
As Google says under the Chrome Extension for U2F protocol, \emph{``support for this compiled U2F Chrome extension is being formally deprecated. No further updates or enhancements are planned, and migration to using the support built into Chrome or migration to WebAuthn is recommended''}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/google/u2f-ref-code/tree/master/u2f-chrome-extension}}. This is also the motivation under manually importing the file \texttt{u2f-api.js} into the client-side of my application.

Future works with authentication using security keys should address the standard WebAuthn~\cite{webauthn}.

In addition, this sample can be used as a template for developing meaningful web applications that harness databases and a more complex structure.
