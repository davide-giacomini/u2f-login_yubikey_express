\section{Conclusion}
With this report I analyzed in detail the reasons why security keys appear to be more secure than other commonly used second factor technologies.

I outlined how the YubiKey Security Key NFC works under the hood, focusing on the parts of the protocol which are more meaningful from a security and development point of view. I did not analyze the cryptographic standards, as it was not my intention.

Finally, I explained how I used those protocols to develop a small, sample web application, taking also inspiration by a brief tutorial.

My main objective was to show to the reader how convenient is to use a security key, both from the perspective of the user and the developer.
